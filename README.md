# FBI Gun Data

FWD Data Analysis Professional Nanodegree Program from Udacity project II.

## Overview
In this project, I analyzed a FBI Gun dataset and then ?created a report to documents my findings.

## Software Requirements
* Python3
* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

I recommend installing Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook.

### The Dataset
The data comes from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The NICS is used by to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. Gun shops call into this system to ensure that each customer does not have a criminal record or isn’t otherwise ineligible to make a purchase. The data has been supplemented with state level data from census.gov.
* The "NICS" data is found in one sheet of an .xlsx file. It contains the number of firearm checks by month, state, and type.
* The "U.S. census" data is found in a .csv file. It contains several variables at the state level. Most variables just have one data point per state (2016), but a few have data for more than one year.
